# Log4Delphi
The Log4Delphi library is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of output targets. Log4Delphi is a port of the excellent Apache log4jâ„¢ framework to Delphi. I have kept the framework similar in spirit to the original log4j while keeping Delphi in mind

## Output to multiple logging targets
